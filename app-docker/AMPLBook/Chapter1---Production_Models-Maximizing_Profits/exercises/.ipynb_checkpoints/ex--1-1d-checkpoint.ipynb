    "This exercise starts with a two-variable linear program similar in structure to the one of Sections 1.1 and 1.2, but with a quite different story behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) You are in charge of an advertising campaign for a new product, with a budget of $\\$$1 million. You can advertise on TV or in magazines. One minute of TV time costs $\\$$20,000 and reaches 1.8 million potential customers; a magazine page costs $\\$$10,000 and reaches 1 million. You must sign up for at least 10 minutes of TV time. How should you spend your budget to maximize your audience? Formulate the problem in AMPL and solve it. Check the solution by hand using at least one\n",
    "of the approaches described in Section 1.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) It takes creative talent to create effective advertising; in your organization, it takes three\n",
    "person-weeks to create a magazine page, and one person-week to create a TV minute. You have\n",
    "only 100 person-weeks available. Add this constraint to the model and determine how you should\n",
    "now spend your budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Radio advertising reaches a quarter million people per minute, costs $\\$$2,000 per minute, and\n",
    "requires only 1 person-day of time. How does this medium affect your solutions?\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) How does the solution change if you have to sign up for at least two magazine pages? A maximum of 120 minutes of radio?"

    "\n",
    "1. Adding radio as a medium for advertisement, improved objective cost function. \n",
    "2. Shadow price for budget constraint reduced from ~$\\$$88 to ~$\\$$86. Almost no impact to this constraint.  \n",
    "3. Shadow price for person-week constraint increased significantly ~$\\$$40,000 to ~$\\$$77,777. Adding radio as a medium has now increased shadow price of person-week. Adding radio as a medium has increased the importance of person-week constraint.\n",
    "4. Finally:\n",
    " * Once again, TV medium is no more at the minimum minutes once the person-week constraint was added. \n",
    " * Magazine as a medium is not preferred anymore. Only radio and TV enters the solution, magazine is no more a pereferred medium. \n",
    " * The person-week required for TV and radio is very less while for magazine is higher. Making it attractive to allocate all the budget between TV and radio only. This is also indicative of person-week constraint causing the magazine variable to leave the solution. \n",
    "5. Adding an upper bound of 120 radio minutes as no impact to the solution. The objective remains same as in 1-1c. The reduced costs and constraint shadow prices (dual prices) also has no change because the radio minutes variable (=50) is in between the min and max bounds. \n",
    "6. Adding the min pages for the magazine, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    (a) reduced the objective cost function from $\\$$93.88million to $\\$$93.7million. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    (b) Adding this min bound did not cause any change to the shadow price for either constraints. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    (c) This means that at a min bound of 2 magazine pages, there is no additional impact to the constraints. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    (d) The min bound of 2 magazine pages, did not impact reduced costs for all three variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (e) An interesting observation is that, adding a min bound of 2 pages, made the solution for all variables an integer value. In the previous case (1-1c), the solutions were non-integers. \n",
    "7. A note here is that, TV minute and Magazine pages variables have no upper bounds. This was modelled by setting the upper bounds to 9999. "
